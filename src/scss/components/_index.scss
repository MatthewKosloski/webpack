// Components
// ==========
//
// For small components, there is the components folder. While layout is macro 
// (defining the global wireframe), components is more focused on widgets. 
// It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, 
// and basically anything along those lines. 
// 
// There are usually a lot of files in components since the whole site should 
// be mostly composed of tiny modules.
